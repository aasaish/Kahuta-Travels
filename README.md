I am excited to announce the completion of "Kahuta Travels," a comprehensive web-based bus reservation system that revolutionizes the way travelers plan their journeys. This project encompasses a range of functionalities tailored to enhance user experience and streamline the booking process.

Key Features:

Homepage: Provides an inviting introduction to Kahuta Travels, featuring highlights of our services and easy navigation to other sections.

Schedule Page: Offers a detailed view of bus schedules, enabling users to search and filter by routes, timings, and availability. This page ensures travelers can plan their trips efficiently.

About Us: A dedicated section that introduces Kahuta Travels, showcasing our mission, values, and commitment to delivering exceptional travel experiences.

Reservation System: Central to the platform is our robust reservation system. Users can select their desired routes, view seat availability through an interactive seating map, and proceed to book their seats securely.

User Authentication: To ensure security and personalized service, the reservation process requires users to log in or sign up. This feature allows us to tailor booking options and provide users with access to their booking history and preferences.

Ticket Generation: Upon successful reservation, users can instantly generate downloadable tickets in PDF format. JavaScript is used alongside PHP to dynamically create and deliver these tickets, which contain vital journey details such as seat numbers, departure times, and bus information, ensuring a seamless travel experience.

Technological Implementation:

Backend: Developed using PHP and MySQL, the backend supports efficient data management, including user authentication, reservation handling, and schedule updates.

Frontend: Utilizes HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create a responsive and intuitive user interface. The design focuses on accessibility and ease of use across various devices, from desktops to smartphones.

PDF Generation: Integrates JavaScript libraries for PDF generation, enhancing convenience for users while maintaining a professional presentation of booking information.
